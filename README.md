# Take-home information
## :hammer: Toolkit 1: lifecycle management of lithium batteries
| **Item** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Project Scope | The toolkit addresses the comprehensive lifecycle management of lithium batteries, with an emphasis on standardization and sustainable use. | 
|Strategy| The goal is to build a sustainable future for lithium batteries through innovative design, safety measures, and effective recycling methods. |
| Innovation| The toolkit highlights innovative strategies to improve the sustainability of the lithium battery lifecycle (from manufacturing to disposal).|   
| Standardization| It presents seven standard sizes of LiPo batteries (P6 to P0) designed to accommodate a wide range of devices. |
| Design| This toolkit presents a common battery design that is safe, easy to handle and disassemble, and designed to promote recycling. |   
| Handling and Storage| Provides practical solutions for the safe handling, storage and disposal of used or damaged batteries. |   
| Manufacturing, Distribution and Supply Chain| This toolkit explores the fundamental aspects of manufacturing, distributing and maintaining a supply chain that prioritizes sustainability and resource recovery. |
| Safety | Safety is paramount with the introduction of a unique color-changing material on the battery that provides a visual alert if the battery becomes unsafe. The labeling protocol further enhances security by ensuring that essential information is clearly visible on each battery. |

## :hammer: Toolkit 2: Battery usage impact evaluation framework
| **Item** | **Description** |
| --- | ---|
| Motivation| Help people to evaluate the impact of their battery usage.|
| Evaluation metrics| Battery transportation, material consumption, extraction pollution, battery security, battery Cycle life, recycle rate.| 
| Evaluation process | 1.Identify your battery; 2.Assess the battery impact; 3. Get the impact outcome.|
